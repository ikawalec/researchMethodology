\begin{abstract}  

The reason of this document is to normalise, support and define Systematic Literature Review process for the topic.
It would be define problems that lurk for complex database systems used in big enterprises. 
It would be discuss the differences, virtue and vice of database systems based on Relational Databases and Object Orientated Databases.
It would be list objectives which will help achieving the aim.

\Section{Introduction}

Databases are used almost in all aspects of software engineering. Each 
information systems needs a place to storage a data. But each system is different
and requires different approaches. The key roles is to select the right solution.
In nowadays global web applications involves handling of huge load, high performance and
availability. Good examples of such services are Facebook or Google Mail.

Relational databases occurs to be inefficient in this case. Strong complexity and
heave coupling causes low performance. The solution for that issues are Object Oriented
Databases which ensure high scalability.

Our aim is to compare available NoSQL databases and to select the best one by evaluating 
optimal architecture that will fulfil requirements. 

The first step to achieve this target is to investigate systematic literature review in this area.
By doing it we want to find out answers for our research questions.

This kind of knowledge is really valuable from enterprise perspective. However each database
system has different requirements so it is impossible to prepare one common solution.
 
%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Background}

Database is organised collection of data. It can be discriminated two types, 
Relation Databases and Object Oriented Databases.

Relation database consists of specific number of tables and each has a distinguish column named primary key. 
They are matured, well documented, tested and commonly used. Several examples of then are: MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL, PostgreSQL.

Object oriented database was developed in response to expansion of object oriented programming. In addition to ensure high scalability and  
performance in current information systems.

The architecture of database system has a big influence of performance. Single machine has a limited
resources, so this is a reason why enterprise systems  are composed of a lot of them.

\Section{Research Questions}

During the Systematic Research Review following questions will be posed: 

maxymalnie dwa punkty, wywalic

\begin{itemize}
  \item What are all available NoSQL databases
  \item co do tej pory zostalo zreserczerowane na ten temat 
\end{itemize}

tutaj outcomes - co jest wynikiem researchu - spodziewane

The outcomes of the research would be knowledge what has been written in topic of our interest. // sprawd?cie czy to zdanie ma jaki? sens

\Section{Research method}

The method we have chosen for our research is Systematic Literature Review defined by Kitchenham. For detailed information, please see \cite{kitchenham}.

\emph {A systematic literature review is a means of identifying, evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular 
research question, or topic area, or phenomenon of interest.} \cite[p.~3]{kitchenham}
~\\
~\\
Systematic Literature Review it is a search of all available studies and scientific articles in the field to see what was written on The Topic. 
This is done befor research work, becouse it is important not to investigate something that is allready well explore by someone. To achieve this 
we have to be very honest and rigorous for ourselves and our review. The bases of SLR are creating a protocol and well documenting it. One of 
purpose of documenting it is to enable for someone from the outside to asses the quality of our work. 

We can split it to 3 stage: planing, conducting and reporting. In planing stage we define our needs, our questions, create and evaluate 
protocol. Next in conducting phase we execute our protocol and estimate quality of results, extract data out of it and synthesise this 
data. The last stage - reporting review consists of: defining how we would distibute effects of our work, compose general report from whole 
SLR and rating it. As can be seen in every stage there is a quality assessment of particular works - the aim is to determine the quality level of final outcomes.
~\\
It is worth to mention that to achieve better effects we should made iterations of individual step or groups of steps. During these iterations, protocol that is used could be impoved.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Protocol}

We developed a protocol for the systematic review by following the guidelines enclosed in [1]. This protocol specified the research questions, search
strategy, inclusion, exclusion and quality criteria, data extraction, and methods of synthesis.

\SubSection{Inclusion and exclusion criteria}


Studies were eligible for inclusion in the review if the topic was about NoSQL databases. We decided that we need to find as many information regarding this topic as posible.
The second criteria was if the studies are releated with high performance or high scale for either SQL or NoSQL databases. Only studies written in English were included.
We also included papers which covers comparision of available NoSQL databases.

Studies were excluded if they main focus was on SQL databases without considering high performance or large scale problems. In addition if research focused on complicated databases system
with huge complexity (those which follows third normal form or higher) it was also excluded. Furthermore, our reseach topis is highly related with industry, so we excluded all papers 
which does not have any usage in industry.

\SubSection{Data sources and search strategy}


For search strategy it was choose to search digital libraries like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ACM
	\item IEEEXplore
	\item Compendex
	\item Google Scholar
	\item SpringerLink
\end{itemize}

There were searched using following searched phrase:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item NoSQL and SQL
	\item high performance database
	\item large scale database
	\item NoSQL comparision
	\item database scalability
\end{enumerate}

\Section{Execution of protocol}

opisac jak to sie tam szukalo, czyli ze szukalismy, znalezlismy 200,
wyjebalismy 100 na podstawie czegos, potem wyjebalismy 80 na podstawie 
czegos tam innego. A potem po przeczytaniu ich wyjebalismy jescze 16 i zostaly
4

\ldots

%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

\Section{Analisis}   

na podstawie protokolu, tych prac ktore wybralismy, czytami i dokonujemy analizy ich.
analiza to badanie kazdej pracy.

\Section{Synthesize}   

A synteza to przetowozenie wynikow i zabranie tego do kupy.

\ldots

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Conclusion} 

trzeba napisac ze takie a takie rzeczy sa juz opisane dobrze, ale znalezlismy dziura, ktora
nie zostala jeszcze dobrze zliteralizowana i sie fajnie
