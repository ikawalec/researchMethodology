\begin{abstract}  

The reason of this document is to normalise, support and define Systematic Literature Review process for the topic.
It would be define problems that lurk for complex database systems used in big enterprises. 
It would be discuss the differences, virtue and vice of database systems based on Relational Databases and Object Orientated Databases.
It would be list objectives which will help achieving the aim.

\Section{Introduction}

Databases are used almost in all aspects of software engineering. Each 
information systems needs a place to storage a data. But each system is different
and requires different approaches. The key roles is to select the right solution.
In nowadays global web applications involves handling of huge load, high performance and
availability. Good examples of such services are Facebook or Google Mail.

Relational databases occurs to be inefficient in this case. Strong complexity and
heave coupling causes low performance. The solution for that issues are Object Oriented
Databases which ensure high scalability.

Our aim is to compare available NoSQL databases and to select the best one by evaluating 
optimal architecture that will fulfil requirements. 

The first step to achieve this target is to investigate systematic literature review in this area.
By doing it we want to find out answers for our research questions.

This kind of knowledge is really valuable from enterprise perspective. However each database
system has different requirements so it is impossible to prepare one common solution.
 
%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Background}

Database is organised collection of data. It can be discriminated two types, 
Relation Databases and Object Oriented Databases.

Relation database consists of specific number of tables and each has a distinguish column named primary key. 
They are matured, well documented, tested and commonly used. Several examples of then are: MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL, PostgreSQL.

Object oriented database was developed in response to expansion of object oriented programming. In addition to ensure high scalability and  
performance in current information systems.

The architecture of database system has a big influence of performance. Single machine has a limited
resources, so this is a reason why enterprise systems  are composed of a lot of them.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Research Questions}

During the Systematic Research Review following questions will be posed: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item What are all available NoSQL databases
  % \item co do tej pory zostalo zreserczerowane na ten temat
  % to summarize existing \ldots 
  \item How advanced research on large scale and high performace NoSQL databases are 
\end{itemize}

% tutaj outcomes - co jest wynikiem researchu - spodziewane
% TODO
% // sprawd?cie czy to zdanie ma jaki? sens
The outcomes of the research would be knowledge what has been written in topic of our interest.

\Section{Research method}

The method we have chosen for our research is Systematic Literature Review defined by Kitchenham. For detailed information, please see \cite{kitchenham}. 
~\\
~\\
\emph {A systematic literature review is a means of identifying, evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular 
research question, or topic area, or phenomenon of interest.} \cite[p.~3]{kitchenham}
~\\
~\\
Systematic Literature Review it is a search of all available studies and scientific articles in the field to see what was written on The Topic. 
This is done before research work, because it is important not to investigate something that is already well explored by someone. To achieve this 
we have to be very honest and rigorous for ourselves and our review. The bases of SLR are creating a protocol and well documenting it. One of 
purpose of documenting it is to enable for someone from the outside to asses the quality of our work. 

We can split it to 3 stage: planing, conducting and reporting. In planing stage we define our needs, our questions, create and evaluate 
protocol. Next in conducting phase we execute our protocol and estimate quality of results, extract data out of it and synthesise this 
data. The last stage - reporting review consists of: defining how we would distibute effects of our work, compose general report from whole 
SLR and rating it. As can be seen in every stage there is a quality assessment of particular works - the aim is to determine the quality level of final outcomes.
~\\
It is worth to mention that to achieve better effects we should made iterations of individual step or groups of steps. During these iterations, protocol that is used could be impoved.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Protocol}

We developed a protocol for the systematic review by following the guidelines enclosed in [1]. This protocol specified the research questions, search
strategy, inclusion, exclusion and quality criteria, data extraction, and methods of synthesis.

\SubSection{Inclusion and exclusion criteria}

Studies were eligible for inclusion in the review if the topic was about NoSQL databases. We decided that we need to find as many information regarding this topic as possible.
The second criteria was if the studies are releated with high performance or high scale for either SQL or NoSQL databases. Only studies written in English were included.
We also included papers which covers comparision of available NoSQL databases.

Studies were excluded if they main focus was on SQL databases without considering high performance or large scale problems. In addition if research focused on complicated databases system
with huge complexity (those which follows third normal form or higher) it was also excluded. Furthermore, our reseach topis is highly related with industry, so we excluded all papers 
which does not have any usage in industry.

\SubSection{Data sources and search strategy}  

For search strategy it was choose to search digital libraries like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ACM
	\item IEEEXplore
	%\item Compendex
	\item Google Scholar
	%\item SpringerLink
\end{itemize}

Moreover, Google was used to expand result of systematic research review.

Data sources were searched using following phrases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item NoSQL database 
	\item NoSQL and SQL
	\item high performance database
	\item large scale database
	\item NoSQL comparision
	\item database scalability
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Execution of protocol}

%opisac jak to sie tam szukalo, czyli ze szukalismy, znalezlismy 200,
%wyjebalismy 100 na podstawie czegos, potem wyjebalismy 80 na podstawie 
%czegos tam innego. A potem po przeczytaniu ich wyjebalismy jescze 16 i zostaly 4

Once we have defined search citeria of our interest, we started literature extration process.
Search phrases were combined by using boolean operators OR and AND:

\emph{(nosql OR sql OR nosql sql) AND database AND (comparison OR high performance OR large scale OR scalability)}
  
We went through data sources to find answer for research questions.
In ACM digital library we discovered 70 related results, 41 articles were found in IEEEXplore and finally 48 materials in Google Scholar.
Summing up 159 materials were investigated. 

Based on exclusion criteria some of references were rejected. A lot of examinated works were too basic or were focues only on SQL databases.
Finally we received 16 scientific artices, 1 book, 1 Master Thesis and 1 website which will be described in next section. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

\Section{Analisis}   

% TODO pl na podstawie protokolu, tych prac ktore wybralismy, czytami i dokonujemy analizy ich.
% analiza to badanie kazdej pracy.

Good starting point describing NoSQL databases in general, can be found in \cite{survey}, \cite{strauch}, \cite{leavittm} and \cite{prasad}. Interesting 
comparison of NoSQL and SQL databases was promised in article \cite{cattell}. Although a lot of references points to some popular NoSQL database currently 
available and commonly used, but the biggest source was found on website \cite{nosql-database} (almost 150 NoSQL databases). Practial aspects of using NoSQL 
databases in web applications were contained in \cite{tiwari} \cite{orend}, \cite{pokorny}. High performance issues were mentioned in \cite{taniar} and \cite{delis}.
Hudge amounts of articles refers to cloud solutions (\cite{sakr}, \cite{konstantinou}, \cite{delis}). Some of the articles describes database system with hudge 
complexity \cite{rizzotti}. 

\Section{Synthesize}   

% TODO PL A synteza to przetowozenie wynikow i zabranie tego do kupy.

% Jeśli chodzi o listę dostępnych baz NoSQL to mimo ich dużej ilości tylko 5-7 głownych baz jest dobrze opisane w literaturze.
% Jeśli chodzi o wydajność to dużo odnosi się do usług w chmurze
% Mało jest artykułów które konkretnie opisują jakiś scenariusz i zalejacą którą bazę wybrać do tworzonego projektu

In analysed articles only most popular NoSQL databases were described, e.g HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra, SimpleDB.
Invesitaged works contains valuable information concerning high performance and scalability. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Conclusion} 

% TODO PL trzeba napisac ze takie a takie rzeczy sa juz opisane dobrze, ale znalezlismy dziura, ktora
% nie zostala jeszcze dobrze zliteralizowana i sie fajnie

% Luką jest brak konkretnych przykładów użycia nosql baz danych w aplikacjach webowych 

During systematic literature review we encounter some gap.
There is really no specific document which would describe real world scenario like database for web 
application able to handle 1 milion of users.
