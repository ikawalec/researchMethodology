\begin{abstract}  

The purpose of this document is to present project proposal of Large Scale and High Performance NoSQL Databases in Web Applications. 

In our project we are going to present comparison between available NoSQL databases and architecture which
provides high performance for large scale web applications.

The outcome of this paper are aims and objectives, research question and expected outcomes, choosed methods which will be used in the research
and presentation of project plan.

\Section{Introduction}

Databases are used almost in all aspects of software engineering. Each 
information system needs a place to storage a data. Furthermore databases are essential for internet services.

Modern web applications should be able to handle a huge load and provide high performance. 
Good examples of such services are Facebook, Amazon, eBay and Google Mail. Most of them use NoSQL databases
instead of SQL to achieve better performance.

A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that use looser consistency models 
than traditional relational databases in order to achieve horizontal scaling and higher availability. Some authors 
refer to them as "Not only SQL" to emphasize that some NoSQL systems do allow SQL-like query language to be used.

The architecture of database system has a big influence of performance. Single machine has a limited
resources, so this is a reason why enterprise systems are composed of a lot of them.

We have done a Systematic Literature Review for this topic. There are some studies describing high performance 
and scalable NoSQL databases, but there is really no specific document which would describe real world scenario like 
database (type, configuration) for web application able to handle millions of users. This is a gap we want to fulfill.

\Section{Aims and Objectives}

Aims
\begin{itemize}
	\item to evaluate performance of NoSQL databases for large scale web applications.
\end{itemize}

Objectives
\begin{itemize}
	\item to design architecture of system for high performance and large scale web application using NoSQL databases
	\item to develop an optimal configuration for prepared architecture for each database
	\item to measure reading and writing response time of the system for each database
\end{itemize}


\Section{Expected Outcomes}

The expected outcomes of the research are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item architecture and configuration of NoSQL databases which provides high performance on large scale database systems
  \item tests results of measuring reading/writing response time of each NoSQL databases on prepared architecture and configuration.
\end{itemize}

\Section{Research Questions}

In our paper we want to give answers to the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the best architecture for large scale, high performance NoSQL databases?
  \item How to configure NoSQL databases to gain maximum efficiency?
  \item How to carry out database performance testing?
  \item Which NoSQL database is the best for large scale, high performance database systems?
\end{itemize}
 
\Section{Methods}

For the first step of our research: design architecture and preparing configuration, we decided to use Action Research method.
We are going to choose most known databases using rankings available on the internet and then by investigating
documentation learn more about them and find out how to design and configure a system to be the most efficient.

To tests the databases we are going to conduct an experiment. We want to measure response time of the large scale
system for each database.

\Section{Project Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Choose the five most used NoSQL databases
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Find articles describing NoSQL databases
	  \item Choose five the most often used databases according to articles 
	\end{enumerate}
  \item Design an architecture of the system
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Find methods which are used for building large scale database systems
	  \item Find which methods ensure high performance
	  \item Use methods to design an architecture
	\end{enumerate}
  \item Find out the configuration for each database to be the most efficient on prepared architecture
    \begin{enumerate}
	  \item Find the optimization techniques for database dedicated systems
	  \item Find the database configuration to optimize operations on lots of data
	  \item For each database build system for designed architecture using prepared configuration
	\end{enumerate}
  \item Measure response times of each database
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Prepare test suites
      \item Measure read and write time   
    \end{enumerate}  
\end{enumerate}
