\begin{abstract}  

The aim of this document is to present comparision between available NoSQL databases and architecture which
provides high performance for large scale web applications.

Most known 10 NoSQL databases has been investigated and compared with each other. We have analyzed the advantages 
and disadvantages of using NoSQL databases in compare with SQL databases. 

We choosed the best NoSQL database and built a system which provide fast response time on reading and writing operation
under heavy load when contains huge size of data.

As the outcome of this paper we described the architecture, configuration and presented results of tests.

\Section{Introduction}

Databases are used almost in all aspects of software engineering. Each 
information system needs a place to storage a data. However, due to the complexity of the systems 
the key role is to provide the proper solution.

Modern web applications should handle a huge load and maintain high performance and
availability. Good examples of such services are Facebook, Amazon, eBay and Google Mail.

Relational databases occur to be inefficient in this case. Strong complexity and
heave coupling causes low performance. The solution for that issues are Object Oriented
Databases which ensure high scalability.

Our aim is to compare available NoSQL databases and to select the best one by evaluating 
optimal architecture that will fulfill requirements. 

The first step to achieve this target is to investigate systematic literature review in this area.
It can be done by finding answers to research questions.

This kind of knowledge is really valuable from enterprise perspective. However, each database
system has different requirements so it is impossible to prepare one common solution. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Research Questions}

During the Systematic Research Review following questions will be posed: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item What NoSQL databases are described in the publications
  \item What is known about high performance and large scale NoSQL databases   
\end{itemize}

The expected outcome of the research is a collection of publications concerned with the topic of our intereset.
